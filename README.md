# Portfolio

This week i have build a portfolio page, which you can be added too as the week go on.

A portfolio can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. In this portfolio i have highlighted points in my process that work well and showcases the thought and processes behind it creating a website portfolio. My portfolio will be deployed live on the web and will also be edited throughout camp to hopefull aid me in having a successful career search after the boot camp. 

This challenge we set me up for future success by applying the core skills i have recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. 

Below is a screenshoot link of myRepo
